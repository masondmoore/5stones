    <p> Swear to me!

Never start with the head. The victim gets all fuzzy. He can't feel the next... See?

You have nothing, nothing to threaten me with. Nothing to do with all your strength.

It's simple. We, uh, kill the Batman.

No, no, no, I kill the bus driver.

But we've met before. That was a long time ago, I was a kid at St. Swithin's, It used to be funded by the Wayne Foundation. It's an orphanage. My mum died when I was small, it was a car accident. I don't remember it. My dad got shot a couple of years later for a gambling debt. Oh I remember that one just fine. Not a lot of people know what it feels like to be
angry in your bones. I mean they understand. The fosters parents. Everybody understands, for a while. Then they want the angry little kid to do something he knows he can't do, move on. After a while they stop understanding. They send the angry kid to a boy's home, I figured it out too late. Yeah I learned to hide the anger, and practice smiling in the mirror.
It's like putting on a mask. So you showed up this one day, in a cool car, pretty girl on your arm. We were so excited! Bruce Wayne, a billionaire orphan? We used to make up stories about you man, legends and you know with the other kids, that's all it was, just stories, but right when I saw you, I knew who you really were. I'd seen that look on your face before.
 It's the same one I taught myself. I don't why you took the fault for Dent's murder but I'm still a believer in the Batman. Even if you're not...</p>

    <p> Well these conversation used to end with an unusual request. Well, let me show you some stuff, anyway. Just for old times' sake.

Ah yes! I was wondering what would weight first. Your spirit... or your body?

It's not who I am underneath but what I do that defines me.

I'm not sure you made it loud enough, sir.

I just the took to calling it the Bat. And yes Mr. Wayne, it does come in black.

It's ends here.

Carbon fiber, .28 caliber, made in China. If you wanna kill a public servant, Mr Maroni... I recommend you buy American.

We have purged your fear. You are ready to Iead these men. You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows. But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.</p>
